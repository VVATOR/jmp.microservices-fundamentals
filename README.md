# jmp.microservices-fundamental

Practical course oriented to building Microservices Architecture. It is aimed to show of microservices architecture,
learn tools, technologies and patterns that are more commonly used in microservices architecture such as API Gateway,
Service Discovery, Circuit Breaker.

### What to do

To execute this module, should be used a ready-made artifact obtained after executing
the [introduction-to-microservices](https://git.epam.com/epm-cdp/global-java-foundation-program/java-courses/-/tree/main/introduction-to-microservices)
program and make some changes to the base structure of microservices system.
During this task you need to:

+ Make structural changes to existing microservices:
    - **Resource Service**

+ Implement a new microservice:
    - **Resource Processor**

### Sub-task 1: Resource Service

For a **Resource Service**, it is recommended to make structural changes as described bellow.

- **Resource Service** should use cloud storage or its emulation (
  e.g. [S3 emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)) to store the source file. Previously, the resource file
  was stored in the service database.
- Resource tracking (with resource location in the cloud storage) should be carried out in the underlying database of
  the service.

When uploading a mp3 file, the **Resource Service** should process the file in this way:

- Save the source file to a cloud storage or its emulation (
  e.g. [S3 emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)).
- Save resource location (location in the cloud storage) in the underlying database of the service.
- The **Resource Service** should not invoke any other services this time.

### Sub-task 2: Resource Processor

This service will be used to process the source MP3 data in the future and will not have a web interface. At this point,
this should be a basic Spring Boot application capable of extracting MP3 metadata for further storage using the **Song
Service** API.
An external library can be used for this purpose.(
e.g. [Apache Tika](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tika/tika_extracting_mp3_files.htm)).

Implement initial version of each service:

- Basic structure (Spring Boot)

## NOTES:

- After start localstack should run initialization hook that create s3 bucket from
  script `docker-compose/scripts/localstack/init-s3.sh`


- Localstack endpoints

    - access to s3 busket: [http://localhost:4566/localstack-s3-bucket](http://localhost:4566/localstack-s3-bucket)
      where `localstack-s3-bucket` name of existing bucket;
    - Health check
      localstack: [localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/health](localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/health)
