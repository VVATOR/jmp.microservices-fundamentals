# jmp.microservices-fundamental

Practical course oriented to building Microservices Architecture. It is aimed to show of microservices architecture,
learn tools, technologies and patterns that are more commonly used in microservices architecture such as API Gateway,
Service Discovery, Circuit Breaker.

### What to do

To execute this module, should be used a ready-made artifact obtained after executing
the [introduction-to-microservices](https://git.epam.com/epm-cdp/global-java-foundation-program/java-courses/-/tree/main/introduction-to-microservices)
program and make some changes to the base structure of microservices system.
During this task you need to:

+ Make structural changes to existing microservices:
    - **Resource Service**

+ Implement a new microservice:
    - **Resource Processor**

### Sub-task 1: Resource Service

For a **Resource Service**, it is recommended to make structural changes as described bellow.

- **Resource Service** should use cloud storage or its emulation (
  e.g. [S3 emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)) to store the source file. Previously, the resource file
  was stored in the service database.
- Resource tracking (with resource location in the cloud storage) should be carried out in the underlying database of
  the service.

When uploading a mp3 file, the **Resource Service** should process the file in this way:

- Save the source file to a cloud storage or its emulation (
  e.g. [S3 emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)).
- Save resource location (location in the cloud storage) in the underlying database of the service.
- The **Resource Service** should not invoke any other services this time.

### Sub-task 2: Resource Processor

This service will be used to process the source MP3 data in the future and will not have a web interface. At this point,
this should be a basic Spring Boot application capable of extracting MP3 metadata for further storage using the **Song
Service** API.
An external library can be used for this purpose.(
e.g. [Apache Tika](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tika/tika_extracting_mp3_files.htm)).

Implement initial version of each service:

- Basic structure (Spring Boot)

## NOTES:

- After start localstack should run initialization hook that create s3 bucket from
  script `docker-compose/scripts/localstack/init-s3.sh`


- Localstack endpoints

    - access to s3 busket: [http://localhost:4566/localstack-s3-bucket](http://localhost:4566/localstack-s3-bucket)
      where `localstack-s3-bucket` name of existing bucket;
    - Health check
      localstack: [localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/health](localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/health)

- [Sub-task 2: Events handling](#sub-task-2-events-handling)
- [Sub-task 3: Retry mechanism](#sub-task-3-retry-mechanism)

### What to do

In this module it is needed to adjust services created in the first module with adding cross-servers calls.

### Sub-task 1: Asynchronous communication

1) Add asynchronous communication via messaging broker between **Resource Service** and **Resource Processor**.
2) On resource uploading, **Resource Service** should send information about uploaded resource to the **Resource Processor**, which contains “resourceId”.

[Rabbit MQ](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq), [ActiveMQ](https://hub.docker.com/r/rmohr/activemq) or any other broker usage is possible.

### Sub-task 2: Events handling

1) When the **Resource Processor** has an event of receiving message, it uses a synchronous call to get the resource data (binary) from the **Resource Service**, parses the metadata, and uses the synchronous call to save the metadata of the song in the **Song. Service**.
2) Need to implement some way of queue listening/subscription. For example, [Rabbit Spring Streams](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit/docs/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit.html).

### Sub-task 3: Retry mechanism

While implementing communications between services it’s necessary to think about implementation of **Retry Mechanism**, e.g: [Retry Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry).
Implementation can be based on the [Spring Retry Template](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/reference/html/retry.html) or annotations for both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

**Note**

For this module you could use any of the messaging brokers for asynchronous communication (it’s better to discuss with expert).

- To create Queue, Exchange and Binding should processor (application processor).
